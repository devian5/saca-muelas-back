## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a project to prove our skills on SQL based backend.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

First things first, you need our [repo](https://github.com/devian5/saca-muelas-back/tree/dev), where you can take all the data.

BOTON GET ON POSTMAN

This button will take you to postman, where you can interact with our data base via API.

### Prerequisites
This is the commad to install sequelize, the ORM we used.
```
npm install sequelize-cli -g
```
All our project is docker based. You'll need to have several containers in order to run sql,sequelize and phpmyadmin.
```
docker-compose up
```
Run npm.
```
npm start
```

Then, create a database with this command.
```
sequelize db:create
```
Migrate all our tables.
```
sequelize db:migrate
```
Fill the models with this seeds.
```
sequelize db:seed:all
```
Since we work with docker you don't need to have anything but docker installed on your computer.
